# Video-Game-Sales-and-Engagement-Analysis
focuses on understanding how different game attributes—such as genre, platform, ratings, wishlists, and regional sales—impact overall game performance. The goal was to combine engagement data (ratings, plays, wishlists) with global sales data to uncover insights that can support game developers, marketers, and publishers in making data driven decisions.
The project integrates Python for data cleaning, and Power BI for visualization, resulting in a complete end to end analytics solution.
